# CNN-Project
Project exploring the various methods of increasing the accuracy of a Convolutional Neural Network.
Trained on a library of images to classify which group they would belong to. 
After tuning neural architecture (adding convolutional layers, momentum, switching activation functions), I achieved an accuracy of 99.35%
